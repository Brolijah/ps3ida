  PS3 Jump Table analyser v0.1 for IDA v6.0


:: Install

1) If you have not already installed the PPC-Altivec plugin it is highly
   recommended to do so otherwise IDA will not be able to decrypt
   instructions properly, and the plugin may not be effective

2) For Windows :
     Copy "ppcjt.plw" and "ppcjt.p64" into your "ida\plugins" directory.
   For Linux :
     Copy "ppcjt.plx" and "ppcjt.plx64" into your "ida\plugins" directory.
